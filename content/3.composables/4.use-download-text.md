# useDownloadText

This composable is used to download text content as a file. It is useful when you want to download a code snippet or a text file on your website.

## Installation

To use the `useDownloadText` component in your project, you can install it via npm.

```bash
npx rosalana-dev@latest add DownloadText
```

## Usage

The best way to use the `useDownloadText` composable is when you have a code snippet that your server generates and you want to let the user download it as a file. Many markdown editors have a feature to copy the code snippet. You can use this composable to add a button to also download the code snippet to save your user's time.

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="downloadText">Download</button>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
const downloadText = useDownloadText("code-snippet.txt", "Hello, World!");
</script>
```

The `useDownloadText` composable takes two arguments. The first argument is the file name, and the second argument is the text content that you want to download.

::alert{type="info"}
If you are using Nuxt MDC, you can use the `customPre` component to add a download button to your code snippets.
::

The `customPre` component is not available via npx rosalana-dev. You can see the source code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michalbany/rosalana-cli/blob/main/components/DownloadText/customPre.vue)

Be sure to change the `nuxt.config` file to include the `customPre` component in the `components` array.

```ts
  mdc: {
    components: {
      map: {
        "pre": "CustomPre",
      },
    },
  },
```
