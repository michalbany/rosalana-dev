# Getting Started

This library provides a set of components and composables that you can use and extend in your own projects. All components are built with [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Some of them are also using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) features.


## Installation

::alert{type="danger"}
  This library is not a standalone project. It is meant to be used in your own Vue 3 projects. Installing as a dependency will be probably add later. Not just copy the components code you need.
